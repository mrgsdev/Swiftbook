# UIKit
> `UIKit` - UIKit is a framework that provides a set of tools for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) in applications developed for the iOS platform. It offers various classes and methods for working with interface elements such as buttons, text fields, tables, images, and more. Additionally, UIKit provides mechanisms for managing the application lifecycle, handling user interaction events, and many other functions necessary for creating full-fledged mobile applications on iOS. In the Swift programming language, UIKit is often used for creating user interfaces and handling user input.
